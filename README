This project was written in an attempt to utilize an Arduino Uno motorShield to control forward reverse action using a dual-solenoid switch and H-Bridge.  Signals were decoded using frequency analysis which was documented
through importing data collected through the RXListener class to Excel for further analysis.  Code is written such that users can inherit from the RXListener to implement the basic parts of the algorithm used to listen
for signals (i.e. data sampling, calibration/noise reduction, and registration of the signal).  Any questions don't hesitate to e-mail.  Thanks.
